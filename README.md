- [Practice with modifiers (ref, out) and enum](https://github.com/teafr/Collection-of-practice/tree/practice_with_ref_out_and_enum)

This repository has some of my trainings. It'll update regularly, because I study and want to gather all my practice in one place. 
When I want to recall something, It's very convenient to look up old little projects.
